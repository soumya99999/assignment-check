    Q1. Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11
    Answer: 2x + 3 = 11 ‚Üí 2x = 8 ‚Üí x = 4
    
    Q2. A car travels 240 km in 4 hours. What is its average speed?
    Answer: Average speed = Distance / Time = 240 / 4 = 60 km/h
    
    Q3. Explain Newton's Second Law of Motion in your own words.
    Answer: Newton's Second Law states that Force = Mass √ó Acceleration. It explains how the acceleration of an object depends on its mass and the net force applied.
    
    Q4. The area of a rectangle is 48 square units. If the length is 12 units, find the width.
    Answer: Area = length √ó width ‚Üí 48 = 12 √ó width ‚Üí width = 4 units
    
    Q5. What is the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy sources?
    Answer: Renewable energy sources can be naturally replenished (like solar, wind, hydro). Non-renewable sources (like coal, oil, natural gas) are finite and will eventually run out.
